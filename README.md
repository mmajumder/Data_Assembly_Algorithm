# Script and Validation Data for "A Generalizable Data Assembly Algorithm for Infectious Disease Outbreaks"

Script and validation data for the paper "A Generalizable Data Assembly Algorithm for Infectious Disease Outbreaks" by Maimuna S. Majumder and Sherri Rose.

Each folder contains script and validation data for the three outbreak case studies discussed in this paper. Organization of the repository folders is as follows:
* **data_assembly_algorithm_\[CASESTUDYNAME\].ipynb:** A Python file containing the necessary code for algorithmically assembling the data presented in this paper.
* **DataOutput.csv:** The CSV file to which information from the data assembly algorithm is exported.
* **DataOutput.xslx:** The Excel file to which information from the data assembly algorithm is exported.
* **manually_curated_validation_data_\[CASESTUDYNAME\].csv:** Manually-curated validation data to compare with the data assembly algorithm's performance.
